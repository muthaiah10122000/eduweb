The website features an intuitive layout with dedicated sections for courses, instructors, testimonials, and contact information, making it easy for learners to navigate and explore.

To enhance the visual appeal and user engagement, I implemented smooth animations, hover effects, giving the site a modern and interactive look. The design is completely responsive, ensuring seamless performance across desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

Key highlights of the project include:

🎯 A well-organized multi-page structure built using semantic HTML.

🎯 Responsive layout achieved with CSS Flexbox.

🎯 Custom animations for buttons, images, and section transitions.

🎯 Interactive features powered by JavaScript, including dynamic menus and form validation

🎯 Clean color scheme and typography for a professional educational feel.

This project reflects my ability to build visually appealing, interactive, and mobile-friendly websites while maintaining strong front-end development practices.
